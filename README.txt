Add custom assets in this directory.

The /css, /fonts, /img, and /js directories are used by USWDS. They have this special pathing to allow easier copy/pasting of components from the USWDS site, and are ignored by git.

Any custom files you need shouuld be in this /assets/custom directory. Like /assets/custom/img/my-cool-image.jpg. This assures that any custom assets aren't ignored by git or overridden by USWDS.

Thanks!
