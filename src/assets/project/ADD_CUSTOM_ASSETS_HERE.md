# About this directory 

**IMPORTANT:** Add custom assets in this directory **NOT** directly into `src/assets`.

The `/src/assets/css`, `/src/assets/fonts`, `/src/assets/img`, and `/src/assets/js` directories created when you run `npm run init` are used by USWDS only. They have this special pathing to allow easier copy/pasting of components from the USWDS site, and are ignored by git.

Include any custom assets you need in this directory, like `/assets/project/img/my-cool-image.jpg`. This assures that custom assets aren't ignored by git or overridden by USWDS.

Thanks!
