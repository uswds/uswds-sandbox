          <strong>Zombie Protection</strong>
          The new zombie vaccines are the best way to protect yourself and those around you from serious illness, hospitalization,
          death, and reanimation into a zombie.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Vaccine Problems are Rare</strong>
          The zombie vaccine is safe and effective. Most adults and children have minimal or no side-effects from the
          immunization. If you have any known allergies or other concerns, please talk to your doctor if you have questions about
          getting a zombie vaccine.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Zombie Vaccine is Free</strong>
          The recently authorized Reconstruction Operation and Medical Emergency Relief Order, or ROMERO act, guarantees zombie
          vaccinations are free of charge to all people living in the United States, regardless of health insurance or immigration
          status.
