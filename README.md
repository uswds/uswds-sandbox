# USWDS Sandbox

This branch is a blank slate to use as a basis for testing other frameworks.

## Requirements

- Node v20 (LTS)

## Running code locally

After cloning the template repo, install dependencies using:

```
npm install
```

USWDS assets **won't** be copied. That will depend on your framework of choice.
